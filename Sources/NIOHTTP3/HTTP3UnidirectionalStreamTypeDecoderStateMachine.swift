/// The state machine will read data until a type is found, and then return the `gotStreamType` action.
/// You should continue calling buffer for incoming bytes after the stream type is found.
/// Once you know the type, and have set up downstream handlers accordingly, you must call `unbufferElement` to get the bytes out from this state machines buffers.
/// `unbufferElement` must be called repeatedly until it returns nil.
/// Once it returns nil, no method on this state machine should ever be called again, and the handler holding it should be removed from the pipeline.
